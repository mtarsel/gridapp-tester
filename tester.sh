# grid size, thread count

#
# outputs .csv files in ./testing/thread-count or ./tesining/grid-size like so:
#   [compile flag]_diff_[thread_count | grid_size].csv
#
#For example:
#   grid_diff_thread_count.csv 
#   was compiled with grid size = 10, and executed with 1-10 thread count 
#   with locking on grid
